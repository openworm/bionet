#Artificial biological neural network

bionet simulates a biologically inspired neural network composed of
sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons which can be connected
in arbitrary configurations. Signals propagate through the network one
synapse at a time. A network behavior is defined as a sequence of
sensory-motor neuron firings.

bionet also possesses a network morphogenesis capability:
An isomorphic network reproduces the behaviors of another network
without knowing its interneuron configuration. A homomorphic network
additionally mirrors the interneuron configuration of the other network.

Bionet was inspired by OpenWorm (openworm.org), a project to model the
C Elegans nematode worm in a high fidelity artificial creature. Although
the connectome (neural network) of the worm is known, it is not known
how it produces sensory-motor behaviors. Bionet is an attempt to do this.
A network containing the C Elegans connectome is supplied with
the distribution: CElegans_network.txt. This network has random weights
and can be used to produce sensory-motor behavior sequences. The goal
is to evolve other networks that perform the same behaviors, not
knowing the original network weights. Since C Elegans has close to
4000 synapses, this is a daunting task. However, accomplishing it would
be a huge step toward programming an artificial C Elegans.

##Required packages:

The UNIX version requires the gcc compiler, make command, and
the bash shell. The Windows version requires the Microsoft Visual
C++ 2012 (or later) IDE.

###To build:

UNIX: type 'make'
Windows: use VC++ solution and project files.
